# Unifi Ultimate Blocklist

This repository provides a **comprehensive blocklist** for the **Content Filter** option in **Unifi**.  
It is designed to block most, if not all, recently known **ads, malware, trackers, spyware, and pirate sites**.

## Available Versions

To cater to different user needs, two versions of the blocklist are available:

### 1. With Torrent Sites Blocked

- **Filename:** [`Blocklist with torrent sites.txt`](./Blocklist%20with%20torrent%20sites.txt)  
- **Description:** This version includes entries that block access to known torrent and file-sharing sites. Ideal for environments where such services should be restricted.

### 2. Without Torrent Sites Blocked

- **Filename:** [`Blocklist without torrent sites.txt`](./Blocklist%20without%20torrent%20sites.txt)  
- **Description:** This version excludes entries related to torrent and file-sharing sites. Suitable for networks where such services are permitted.


**Download and upload** directly into the Unifi Controller under the Content Filter Blocklist, or  
**Copy-paste the raw contents** into the Content Filter Blocklist field in your Unifi settings.
